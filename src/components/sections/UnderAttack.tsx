    <Title>Life Under Attack</Title>
    <p>Our life on earth is possible because of the sun but our star is anything but peaceful.</p>
    <p>Raging seas of plasma flow and interact creating powerful magnetic fields which constantly change and tangle with each other.</p>
    <p>Interference between these fields can cause massive accelerations of particles away from the sun and far out into space.</p>
    <p>We can think of this like solar weather with winds and storms.</p>
